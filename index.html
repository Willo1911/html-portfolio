    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my portfolio. I'm a web developer with a degree in mechanical engineering. 
        dvdBecoming a web developer has been a personal goal of mine for a long time, but I hesitated to make the switch—especially in my 30s—because I was afraid of everything that comes with changing careers. 
        Despite the fear, I took the leap, and it’s been one of the best decisions of my life. I absolutely love this career and can’t imagine doing anything else. If you're feeling the same way I once did, just know that you can do it too, my friend. Cheers!
